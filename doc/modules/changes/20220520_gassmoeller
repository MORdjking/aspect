New: The `read_and_distribute_file_content` utility function can now also read
binary files compressed with gzip, which allows for example the StructuredData
class (and therefore all ascii data plugins) to read gzip compressed data.
Compressed files are detected based on their file ending '.gz'. I.e. if you want
to read a compressed file, make sure its name ends in '.gz', and if you want to
read a plain text file, make sure its name does not end in '.gz'. Compressed
files can save around 75% to 80% of disk space for typical ascii data files.
