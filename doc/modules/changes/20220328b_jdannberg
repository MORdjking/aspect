Fixed: The entropy adiabat benchmark did not include
thermal conduction along the adiabat. This has been fixed
by splitting the energy equation into two parts: Conduction
is solved using the temperature field and the 'prescribed
field with diffusion' method, and all remaining terms are
included when solving the equation for the entropy (as a
compositional field). To show that this works correctly,
there are now three more variations of the benchmark,
modeling conduction starting from an adiabatic profile,
conduction of a half-space without adiabatic heating, and
a version of the entropy adiabat benchmark with increased
conduction (all using this new method).
