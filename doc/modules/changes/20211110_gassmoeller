Fixed: The 'random uniform' particle generator plugin would not consider the
volume of each cell correctly when generating a uniform particle density. This
was irrelevant for box models, but would lead to too many particles in cells
close to the bottom of curved models, and too few particles in cells close to
the top of curved models. Box models with initial adaptive refinement were not
affected by this bug. This is fixed now.
